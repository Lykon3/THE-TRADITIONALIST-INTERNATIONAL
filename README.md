🧨 THE TRADITIONALIST INTERNATIONAL 🧨

🕳️ How a Vibe Shift Turned Into a Global Authoritarian Death Cult

> ⚠️ TL;DR: Ancient vibes. Modern tech. Billionaire bros. Global fascism with a philosophical filter. This doc exposes the actual endgame. Not a theory—an ops manual.

🗿 What Is This?

This is the redpill you weren’t supposed to swallow.

> You thought it was all random? That Putin, Xi, Bannon, Modi, Erdoğan, and Tate were just weird dudes in power?
Nah.
They’re running the same playbook—and the footnotes are by Evola.



Welcome to the Traditionalist International:
A decentralized, multi-religious, multi-billion dollar death star built on Perennial Philosophy, algorithmic mind control, and weaponized nostalgia.
It’s not a conspiracy.
It’s a vibe machine with funding.

🔥 Why Should You Care?

Because you’re in it.

Whether you're scrolling TikTok, trading crypto, or vibing in Discord servers, you're swimming in an invisible ideology designed to replace democracy with divine hierarchy and monetize your alienation.

This isn’t about “left vs. right.”
This is about:

🧛 Crypto-funded criminal empires

🧠 AI-boosted radicalization networks

🧎 Spiritual cosplay for political power

🧼 Laundering fascism through vibes, memes & masculinity



---

🧩 Who's Involved?

Putin: Orthodox Voltron

Xi: Confucian 5D Chess

Bannon: Meme war general, Evola enjoyer

Thiel + Yarvin: Silicon Valley monarchy cosplayers

Modi: Caste nostalgia LARP

Erdoğan: Neo-Ottoman boomer mode

Andrew Tate: Trafficker-turned-Traditionalist for the clout and crypto


Together?
They're running the same metaphysical malware—different skins, same source code.

📦 What’s Inside?

🧬 A full breakdown of Traditionalist ideology (Guénon, Evola, Dugin)

🔄 How “sacred hierarchy” is being remixed into every global power structure

🧠 The metapolitical strategy: win the culture, rig the courts, skip the vote

💰 The crypto-criminal-political pipeline

🧨 The final boss: Terrorgram, Tech Bros, and a Supreme Court gone TradCath



---

💡 Read This If:

You ever wondered why authoritarian leaders sound like rejected Hogwarts professors

You’re seeing “TradWives,” “based masculinity,” and “return” memes everywhere

You have a gut feeling something big is syncing up—and no one’s naming it



---

🔓 What Do I Do?

1. 📚 Read the PDF (or at least scroll through it with rage)


2. 🧠 Decode the ideology—it’s hiding in aesthetics, language, and “common sense”


3. 🧵 Thread it. Meme it. Zine it. Drop it in a group chat. Blow this wide open.


4. 🚨 Watch your back—platforms are compromised, and these boys have bots




---

🛑 Final Warning:

This isn’t “aesthetic fascism.”
This is fully weaponized nostalgia, with funding, philosophy, and a criminal income stream.
They’ve turned spiritual yearning into a governance model, and we are the target demographic.

> The TradWave isn’t ironic. It’s strategic.
